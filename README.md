# Ludo Game Design Using Python Turtle

This project demonstrates how to create a simple design of a Ludo game using the Python Turtle module.

## About Ludo

Ludo is a classic board game that originated in India. It is played between 2 to 4 players, and the objective is to move your pieces around the board and into your home area. The first player to move all their pieces into the home area wins.

## Python Turtle

Python Turtle is a graphics library that allows beginners to create shapes and drawings with simple commands. It provides a fun and interactive way to learn programming.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Python comes with the Turtle module built-in, so you don't need to install anything extra.

### Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Run the Python script `ludo_game_design.py`.

    ```bash
    python ludo_game_design.py
    ```

3. The Turtle window will open, displaying the design of the Ludo game board.

## Design Details

### Features

- **Game Board**: Draws the main board of the Ludo game.
- **Squares**: Draws the squares of the game board with different colors.
- **Tokens**: Places tokens (pieces) on the board at their starting positions.

### Customization

You can customize the design according to your preferences by modifying the Python code. Some ideas for customization include:
- Changing colors of the board and tokens.
- Adding animations for token movement.
- Implementing game logic for moving tokens.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to create a Ludo game design using Python Turtle:

```python
import turtle

def draw_square(color, size):
    turtle.begin_fill()
    turtle.fillcolor(color)
    for _ in range(4):
        turtle.forward(size)
        turtle.left(90)
    turtle.end_fill()

def draw_board():
    # Draw the main board
    turtle.penup()
    turtle.goto(-150, 150)
    draw_square("green", 300)

    # Draw the squares
    size = 300 // 15
    for i in range(6):
        for j in range(6):
            x = -150 + i * size * 2
            y = 150 - j * size * 2
            if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
                draw_square("white", size)
            else:
                draw_square("lightgreen", size)
            turtle.goto(x, y)

    # Draw the tokens
    turtle.goto(-120, 120)
    draw_square("red", size)
    turtle.goto(-90, 120)
    draw_square("blue", size)
    turtle.goto(-120, 90)
    draw_square("yellow", size)
    turtle.goto(-90, 90)
    draw_square("green", size)

    turtle.hideturtle()
    turtle.done()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    draw_board()
